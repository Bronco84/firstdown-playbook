# firstdown-playbook
 Demo Laravel/Vue/Tailwind App

I decided to recreate the front-end of the Firstdown Playbook Website for a few reasons:

1. I wanted to demonstrate that I would be a serious, dedicated employee of Firstdown Playbook if given the opportunity.

2. I wanted to become more familiar with the company and the product.

3. Building the front facing site from scratch better demonstrates my familiarity with composer, Laravel, and git, along with a few other newer technologies. 

4. Recreating the website using the same CSS framework as the existing site would only require a "copy/paste" sort of approach that falls short of exhibiting the problem solving skills a great developer should posses.
    
*Notes: I spend most of my time styling with bootstrap 3/4 and utilizing Vue 2 in my applications. Using Tailwind and Vue 3 here is just to highlight my knowledge of new technologies and my ability to adapt to something new. It also happened to be the technology stack available to quickly create a new Laravel application with auth scaffolding already in place acting as a single page application.
